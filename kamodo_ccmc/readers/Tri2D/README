Build library:

1) load python environment supporting Kamodo 
2) run
  python interpolate_tri2d_extension_build.py
  to make _interpolate_tri2d.cpython-*.so shared library file.

Developed on Mac OS Ventura 13.6.5 on M1 hardware 
using 
   python 3.10 and
   gcc-mp-12 installed via MacPorts.

January 2024.


We plan to develop a setup.py for the whole kamodo_ccmc package that builds the library for any OS and architecture automatically or ahead of time as part of a binary distribution.
